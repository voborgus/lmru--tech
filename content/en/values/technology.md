### 1. All codebase are compliant with [InnerSource requirements](https://adeo.github.io/innersource/).

* Codebase accessible for each collaborators and stored in GitHub.
* Non compliant repositories declared as a technical debt and fixed.
* Code review is mandatory.

#### Practices & rituals: 
{{< glossary title="30% rule" >}}
Each engineer may spend some part of his working time on R&D tasks, technical debt reduction or education. 
The percentage it is approximate number and should be determined by technical leader together with the product team.

### 2. We automate everything as much as possible.

* We prefer automated tests rather than manual testing.
* Build & Deploy done by CI tool.

#### Practices & rituals: 
{{< glossary title="DevOps" >}}
A friendship between developers and operations :) If seriously, I would recommend to read [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592) to understand what is it.

We practice DevOps worship as the main approach of product building.
{{< /glossary >}}
{{< glossary title="IaC" >}}
Infrastructure as a Code. We prefer to have automated configuration files rather than manual UI clicks. The configuration file contains a script on how to prepare infrastructure, build, and deploy applications.
{{< /glossary >}}

{{< alert color="warning" title="Antipattern" >}}It is scary to make release because of plenty of manual work and rare occasion.{{< /alert >}}

### 3. Choice of technology aligned with [Technology Table]({{< ref "/stack" >}}).

* Table is kept up-to-date by technology committee.
* All movements in the table are  logged in decision records table.
* We support iniciatives to try new technology or approach after notice of technology committee.

#### Practices & rituals: 
{{< glossary title="Technology Committee" >}}
The committee is a community of enterprise architects, technical architects and technical leaders of development teams and IT infrastructure. The main goal of the committee is the selection and recommendations on the use of technologies in Leroy Merlin Russia and increasing the efficiency of use of company resources. Technologies are understood as programming languages, frameworks and libraries, software tools and approaches in the context of specific usage scenarios.

Meetings are held at least once a month. Leader — CTO.

### 4. Front applications follow [design system](https://zeroheight.com/1165fb04f/).

* All business settings configurable through UI.

{{< alert color="warning" title="Antipattern" >}}Built in store application uses Comic Sans.{{< /alert >}}

### 5. We build cloud native applications. 

* We prefer to run applications inside containers using container orchestrator.
* We prefer stateless applications
* Applications exposes telemetry for analysis and monitoring.
* Applications and databases are replicated and can be sharded.

#### Practices & rituals: 
{{< glossary title="Distributed Tracing" >}}
Each request on the entrance receives a unique tracing ID and pushes this ID with all consequence calls.
{{< /glossary >}}

{{< alert color="warning" title="Antipattern" >}}Monolith uses stored procedures in the database and run in plain hardware.{{< /alert >}}

### 6. We build robust applications and infrastructure.

* We know about production issues before end-users.
* Applications handle partial outages.
* Applications responses accurately and correctly handle wrong inputs.
* Services provides <abbr data-toggle="tooltip" title="Service Level Objective is a goal that service provider wants to reach.">SLO</abbr> and controls them.
* Infrastructure for key systems allows to have master-master replication.

#### Practices & rituals: 
{{< glossary title="VALET" source="https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/slo-engineering-case-studies/" >}}
A way how to track SLO. 

* Volume (traffic) — how much business volume can my service handle?
* Availability — is the service up when I need it?
* Latency — does the service respond fast when I use it?
* Errors — does the service throw an error when I use it?
* Tickets — does the service require manual intervention to complete my request?
