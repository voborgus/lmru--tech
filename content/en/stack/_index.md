We don't use a mono stack approach.
Our wide stack gives us the possibility to use the best tools for each use case, helps to model tech future,
to develop skills and avoid tech and vendor lock-in.

## Technology table
Here is the second version of the way of displaying of a tech stack.
Previously we had Technology Radar, however, this could not be used.

To make the process of choosing technology more clear and simple we going to have a table,
where we have an <abbr data-toggle="tooltip" title="DB, Frontend, backend, etc">area</abbr>
and <abbr data-toggle="tooltip" title="CRUD API, BFF, Process orchestration and so on">use cases</abbr>.
For each use case, we have the <abbr data-toggle="tooltip" title="programming language, framework, product">technology</abbr>
and our attitude to this. Attitude shows: is it the `best choice`, on `research` or on the `trial stage`.
We have the `hold` section where located unaccepted or ancient technologies. Our attitude to each technology
has an explanation of why.

All categories except `research` can work in production.

**Legend:** <code class='lang'>Languages</code> <code class='tool'>Tools</code> <code class='framework'>Frameworks</code>
